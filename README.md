Smart Liquid Level Monitoring System with Real-Time Alerts
The STM32F0 board was integrated with an Ultrasonic module to transmit height information. Whenever the height fell below a specified limit, the user received immediate notifications through both an LED indicator and an LCD display, effectively alerting them about the low height condition.
